Description: This assignment will contain four algorithms written in text format 


Question 1: Prime Number

1) Obtain a positive integer from the user
2) Initialize a varibale called "N" to 0
3) Set the positive integer obtained from the user equal to "N"
4) If "N" = 2 or "N" = 3, "N" is a prime number
5) Divide "N" by 2, and if the remainder is 0, the number is not prime. 
6) If the remainder does not equal 0, continue to divide "N" by every number greater than 2 until the value (N-1) 
7) If you obtain a remainder of 0 at any point, the number is not prime. 
8) If you do not receive a remainder of 0 while dividing each number less than "N" by "N", the number is prime.   


Question 2: Palindrome

1) Obtain a word from the user
2) Initialize variables "first" and "last"
3) Set the first letter of the word equal to "first" and the last letter of the word equal to "last"
4) If "first" does not equal "last", the word is not a palindrome
5) If "first" and "last" equal each other, set the next leftmost letter equal to "first" and the next rightmost letter equal to "last"
6) If "first" does not equal "last", the word is not a palindrome
7) If "first" and "last equal each other, continue the comparison of the next leftmost and rightmost letters until all the letters have been compared. 
8) If all comparisons of "first" and "last" have equaled each other, the word is a palindrome. 


Question 3: Notecards

1) Obtain one notecard from the pile
2) Initialize a variable called "value"
3) Add the number from the first notecard to the variable "value"
4) Take another card from the pile
5) If the number on the new notecard is less than the variable "value", replace "value" with the lesser number on the new notecard
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all 1000 notecards have been picked
7) Display the variable "value"


Question 4: Compute Factorial
1) Obtain the positive number from the user
2) Initialize a variable called "N" to 0
3) Set the positive number obtained from the user equal to "N"
4) Multiply "N" by the difference of (N-1)
5) Initialize a variable called "Factorial" to 0
6) Add the product of N * (N-1) to "Factorial"
7) Set the value of (N-1) to "N" 
8) Repeat steps 4 through 7 until "N" = 1
9) Display value of varibale "Factorial"
